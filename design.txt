3 layer architecture:
Flask is used as front end
Redis is used to store top 100 list of last hour and last day
mySQL is used to store all data on disk

In Redis we keep the following data structures:
3. wiki:topview_day: sorted list of top pages of last day
4. wiki:topview_hour: sorted list of top pages of last hour

In mySQL we store all downloaded results. 
Need a good design for easy generation of top list

Notes:
It seems that the 10th is around 4k, 
whereas the 3000th is around 200.
Need a good way to handle multiple datasets.
One way is to union all tables, but that is going to be super costy.
Hopefully get 5000 is good enough.

use ZUNIONSTORE to union results of last 24 hours 
to get top lists of the past day.
