3 layer architecture:
Flask is used as front end
Redis is used to store top 100 list of last hour and last day
mySQL is used to store all data on disk

In Redis we keep the following data structures:
3. wiki:topview_day: sorted list of top pages of last day
4. wiki:topview_hour: sorted list of top pages of last hour

In mySQL we store all downloaded results. Need a good design for easy generation of top list
