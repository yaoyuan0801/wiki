Redis is used to store page views.
In Redis we keep the following data structures:
1. wiki:file_list: list of source file names. These indicate the time frame in which stats are drawn
2. wiki:page: list of view counts. Each list contain at most 24 values (one day worth of data).
2.5 wiki:page_total: sum of view counts for each page
3. wiki:topview_day: sorted list of top pages of last day
4. wiki:topview_hour: sorted list of top pages of last hour
