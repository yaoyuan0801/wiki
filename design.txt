3 layer architecture:
Flask is used as front end
Redis is used to store all useful data structures
mySQL is used to store all data on disk

In Redis we keep the following data structures:
1. wiki:hourly_page_view: list of keys of scored sets that store the top pages
2. wiki:topview_day: scored set of top pages of last day
3. wiki:topview_{time}: scored set of top pages of last hour
On top of that, a hash for each page is needed to store the url, name and summary.


In mySQL we store all downloaded results. 

TODOs:
A module that downloads and parse the actual wiki page and store the results into the hash
Wikipedia xml dumps are available. We need to get it and then parse it and put it into mySQL

Notes:
It seems that the 10th is around 4k, 
whereas the 3000th is around 200.
Need a good way to handle multiple datasets.
One way is to union all tables, but that is going to be super costy.
Hopefully get 5000 is good enough.

use ZUNIONSTORE to union results of last 24 hours 
to get top lists of the past day.
